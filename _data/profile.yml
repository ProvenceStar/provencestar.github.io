    Hi! I am a first year PhD student at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), School of Computing and Data Science, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://hszhao.github.io/" target="_blank">Hengshuang Zhao</a>. Previously, I received my B.Eng. from the School of Electronic Information and Communications at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) with a GPA of 3.98/4.0 (Rank: 1/155). During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UeltiQ4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Xiang Bai</a>. My current research interests primarily lie in Multimodal Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning.
